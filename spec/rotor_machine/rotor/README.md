Unfortunately a simple substitution cipher is easy to break because letters always map to the same values. The cleverness behind the Enigma machine is that it uses three (or sometimes four) rotors to perform multiple layers of substitution. Rotors are bijective functions that have one to one mappings for every letter. In the enigma machine the rotors step like an odometer or a clock before each letter is processed. Only when the first rotor performs a full rotation will the second rotor turn. Similarly each subsequent rotor will turn after the previous rotor cycles through all 26 positions. The processes of a rotor 'stepping' changes the bijective mapping. Each rotor acts as a substitution cypher and has a forward and reverse (inverse) mapping. The combination of multiple rotors is known as a polyalphabetic substitution cipher.
